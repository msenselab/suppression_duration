## Abstract

When a salient distractor frequently appears in a certain region of a search
display, it interferes less with performance compared to a distractor in a ‘rare’ region.
This effect, known as distractor-location probability cueing, reflects learned proactive
suppression of likely distractor locations. While this effect is well established, it
remains unknown whether this suppression is ongoing (tonic) or deactivated once the
task is completed (phasic). To address this, the present eye-tracking study examined
the time course of learned region-based distractor suppression. Participants searched
for and compared response-critical features of two targets to determine whether to
make a (2AFC) response (‘Go’ trials) or withhold responding (‘No-go’ trials). 
The No-go trials, with extended display presentation, allowed observation of the post-decision
suppression effect via eye movements. In two different experiments, the responsecritical 
features either remained present for the whole trial (Experiment 1) or were
removed halfway through the trial (Experiment 2). We replicated the standard
distractor-location probability-cueing effect. In Experiment 1, distractors in the frequent
region were substantially less likely to attract eye movements early on before the first
target was fixated, and in the late period after inspecting both targets, especially on
No-go trials. However, in Experiment 2, the post-target distractor-region effect
disappeared when the response-critical information was removed. This pattern
indicates that suppression operates phasically and flexibly: it remains active while
needed, but may be deactivated during task-free exploration.
