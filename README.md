## Abstract

When a salient distractor occurs frequently in a certain region of the search display, a distractor appearing in this ‘frequent’ region interferes less with performance compared to a distractor occurring in a ‘rare’ region. This effect, known as distractor-location probability cueing, is taken to reflect learnt proactive suppression of likely distractor locations. While this effect is well established, it remains unknown whether the suppression is a persistent, ongoing process (tonic suppression) or whether it scales back over time once the task is completed (phasic suppression). To address this, the present eye-tracking study examined the time course of learnt region-based distractor suppression in a task requiring participants to search for and compare response-critical features of two targets to determine whether they have to make a (2AFC) response (‘Go’ trials) or withhold responding (‘No-go’ trials). In the latter condition, the search display remained visible for some 2,000 ms until after the (‘No-go’) response decision. We replicated the standard distractor-location (probability-cueing) effect: faster RTs when a distractor was present in the frequent vs. rare region (which was coupled with a target-location effect: slower RTs to a target appearing in the frequent vs. rare region). Interestingly, analysis of oculomotor capture by distractors showed that distractors in the frequent region were substantially less likely to attract an eye movement not only early on, before the first target was fixated, but (especially on No-go trials) also in the late period following the inspection of both targets – arguing in favor of distractor-location suppression operating in a tonic fashion.
